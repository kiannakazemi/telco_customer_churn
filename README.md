# telco_customer_churn

Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a Telco company by analyzing customer data. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, can be a significant challenge for any business. By understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn, companies can develop strategies to retain customers and improve their overall customer satisfaction.

We utilize the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, which contains various customer attributes such as gender, age, contract type, services subscribed, and more. With this data, we aim to build a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn.

Dataset
Dataset Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle
Attribute Information
CustomerID: A unique ID that identifies each customer
Gender: The customerâ€™s gender: Male, Female
Senior Citizen: Indicates if the customer is 65 or older: Yes, No
Partner: Indicates if the customer is the partner of the company: Yes, No
Dependents: Indicates if the customer lives with any dependents: Yes, No
Tenure: Indicates the total amount of months that the customer has been with the company

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing: We perform data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Data Splitting: We split the dataset into training and test datasets to train our predictive model and evaluate its performance effectively.

Class Balance Check: We assess the balance of the target variable 'Churn' to understand if there is an imbalance between churned and non-churned customers.

Modeling with Random Forests: We employ the Random Forest algorithm to train our predictive model. Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning technique that can handle both classification and regression tasks effectively.

Evaluation and Insights: We evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and generate insights that can help the Telco company develop strategies to reduce customer churn.

Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Results
Our predictive model provides valuable insights into customer churn, enabling the Telco company to make informed decisions to retain customers and improve their services.

Future Enhancements
In future iterations of this project, we can consider the following enhancements:

Experiment with different machine learning algorithms for comparison.
Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Deploy the model as a web application or API for real-time predictions.
