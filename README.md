Telco Customer Churn Prediction


This project leverages machine learning to predict customer churn for a Telco company by analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing customer attributes. Customer churn, or the loss of customers, can significantly impact a business's bottom line. By examining factors such as contract type, services subscribed, and customer demographics, our project aims to build a predictive model using Random Forests that can identify customers at risk of leaving. The model's insights can help the Telco company develop strategies to retain customers and improve their services. You can explore our dataset, data preprocessing, model training, and results in this repository, and we welcome contributions and suggestions for further enhancements.
